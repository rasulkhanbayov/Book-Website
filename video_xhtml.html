				<p>Sean Bean as Boromir: a prince of the Stewards of Gondor who journeys with the Fellowship towards Mordor. 
				Bruce Willis, a fan of the book, expressed interest in the role, while Liam Neeson was sent the script, but passed.</p>

				<h4>1. Ian McKellen</h4>

				<img width="200" src="media/gandalf.jpg" alt="Picture of Gandalf"/>
				<p>Ian McKellen as Gandalf: an Istari wizard and mentor to Frodo. Sean Connery was approached for the role, 
				but did not understand the plot, while Patrick Stewart turned it down as he disliked the script.
				Before being cast, McKellen had to sort his schedule with 20th Century Fox as there was a two-month overlap with X-Men,
				in which he portrayed Magneto. He enjoyed playing Gandalf the Grey more than his transformed state in the
				next two films, and based his accent on Tolkien. Unlike his on-screen character, McKellen did not spend much 
				time with the actors playing the hobbits; instead he worked with their scale doubles.</p>
