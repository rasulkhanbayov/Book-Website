				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>Reading books is the most glorious pastime that humankind has yet devised.
				Its feels like travelling the whole world even though being at the same place, 
				sharing our time with other people, being with the superheroes which we love and many more.
				&quot;Isn&apos;t it odd how much fatter a book gets every time you read.&quot; As if something were left 
				behind everytime you read it. Feelings,thoughts,sound,smell and then, when many years later 
				you look at it you see yourself in it.I really love to be lubrocubicularist.Each time 
				you open a book and read it, a tree smiles knowing there&apos;s life after death. Some enjoy 
				reading books in the bed because reading is a halfway between Life and Dreaming.</p>

					<h3>Some quotes about books</h3>
					<q>I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library.</q>
					<cite><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jane Austen in Pride and Prejudice</strong></cite><br>
					<br>
					<q>Books are a uniquely portable magic.</q>
					<cite><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stephen King in On Writing</strong></cite><br>
					<br>
					<q>You don&apos;t have to burn books to destroy a culture. <br>
					Just get people to stop reading them.</q>
					<cite><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ray Bradbury in Fahrenheit 451</strong></cite>
					<br>
				</aside>
				<p>Books, books, books. They will increase your lifespan, lower your stress and boost your intelligence. 
				They will give you fuller, thicker hair. Whatever the breathless claims about reading, 
				one thing is certain: losing yourself in a great novel is one of life&apos;s most enduring 
				and dependable joys. Job satisfaction comes and goes, partners enrapture and abscond, but you can
				always fall back on the timeless ability of literature to transport you to a different world. 
				From Jane Austen&apos;s mannered drawing rooms to the airless tower blocks of 1984, novels do something unique.
			    They simultaneously speak to the heart and mind. They teach you about the history of our world, 
			    the possibilities of our future and the fabric of our souls.</p>
				<p>So where do you start? It&apos;s a fraught question, because the obvious answer &quot;the literary canon&quot;
				means a pantheon of predominantly dead, white dudes. The power structures at play for centuries 
				have meant that a very narrow band of people have been given the opportunity to say something universal
				about the human condition. It&apos;s impossible to ignore these biases: the least we can do is acknowledge 
				them, include different perspectives, and point to some excellent resources here, here and here to discover 
				more writers we should be reading.As it stands, whittling this list down to 40 novels has been a process that
				makes Brexit negotiations look simple and amicable. We hope you enjoy the selection or at least enjoy 
				arguing about who should or should not have made the cut.</p>

				<p>Don Quixote has become so entranced reading tales of chivalry that he
				decides to turn knight errant himself. In the company of his faithful squire,
				Sancho Panza, these exploits blossom in all sorts of wonderful ways. While

				be giants&quot;Sancho acquires cunning and a certain sagacity. Sane madman
				and wise fool, they roam the world together-and together they have haunted
				readers' imaginations for nearly four hundred years.</p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>American novelist, short story writer, and journalist. His distinctive writing
				style is characterized by terse minimalism and understatement and had a
				significant influence on the development of twentieth century fiction.
				Hemingway's protagonists are typically stoics, often seen as projections of
				his own character&quot;men who must show grace under pressure.&quot; Many of
				his works are now considered classics in the canon of American literature.
				He received the Pulitzer Prize in 1953 for The Old Man and the Sea, and the
				Nobel Prize in Literature in 1954.</p>

				<p>Lev Nikolayevich Tolstoy ( 9 September 1828 &#8209;  20 November 1910), usually
				referred to in English as Leo Tolstoy, was a Russian writer who is regarded as
				one of the greatest authors of all time. He received multiple nominations for
				the Nobel Prize in Literature every year from 1902 to 1906, and nominations
				for Nobel Peace Prize in 1901, 1902 and 1910, and the fact that he never won
				is a major Nobel prize controversy. Born to an aristocratic Russian family in
				1828, he is best known for the novels War and Peace (1869) and Anna
				Karenina (1877), often cited as pinnacles of realist fiction.</p>
