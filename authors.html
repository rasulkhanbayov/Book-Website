						<p class="about-info__text">Born in 1948, fantasy writer George R. R. Martin
						grew up in Bayonne, New Jersey. His first
						novel, Dying of the Light, debuted in 1977, and by
						the mid-1980s he was also writing for television. In
						1996 Martin published his first installment of the A
						Song of Ice and Fire fantasy series. He became a
						best-selling author in 2005 with the fourth title of
						the series, A Feast for Crows, paving the way for a
						widely celebrated HBO adaptation that premiered
						as Game of Thrones in 2011.</p>

				<h3 id="early">Early life</h3>
				<p>A leading fantasy author, George R. R. Martin grew up in Bayonne, New Jersey, where his world &quot;was
				five blocks long.&quot; He may have spent his early years staying close to home, but his imagination seemed
				to take him places. The oldest of three children, Martin liked to watch offbeat and suspenseful
				television shows, such as Thriller and The Twilight Zone.
				A conscientious objector during the Vietnam War, Martin worked with the Cook County Legal
				Assistance Foundation as part of his alternative service from 1973 to 1976. He then spent two years as
				a college professor at Clarke College in Dubuque, Iowa.</p>

				<h3 id="writing">Writing career</h3>
				<p>Martin began selling science fiction short stories professionally in 1970, at age 21. His first sale was
				&quot;The Hero&quot;, sold to Galaxy magazine and published in its February 1971 issue; other sales soon
				followed. His first story to be nominated for the Hugo Award and Nebula Awards was "With Morning
				Comes Mistfall", published in 1973 in Analog magazine. In 1975 his story &quot;...for a single yesterday&quot;
				about a post-apocalyptic timetripper was selected for inclusion in Epoch, a science fiction anthology
				edited by Roger Elwood and Robert Silverberg. His first novel, Dying of the Light, was completed in
				1976 right before he moved to Dubuque and published in 1977. That same year the enormous success
				of Star Wars had a huge impact on the publishing industry and science fiction, and he sold the novel
				for the same amount he would make in three years of teaching.</p>
